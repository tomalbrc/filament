filament simplifies adding custom content to Fabric-based Minecraft servers. It allows server owners to add new items, blocks, decorations and even mobs using JSON files—no coding required. Configure a block, item, decoration, or armor, and you're ready to go!

Clients can connect to servers using filament without installing any mods, as it relies on a resource pack, item display entities, and packet-based methods. 

Decorations and other features have minimal server performance impact due to their packet-based nature.

**Use [Polymer's auto-hosting capability](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/) to host the resource pack—no third-party server required.**

**TLDR:** ItemsAdder/Oraxen alternative for Fabric.

  - Armor
  - Cosmetics
  - Items running commands
  - Bows/Crossbows


- **Custom Blocks:** Add your own custom blocks like:
  - Trapdoors

  - Crops
  - Budding blocks


- **Custom Decorations:** Add furniture and decorations with configurable placement and interactions:
  - Benches
  - Showcases/Item-Displays
  - Container
  - Wearable & placeable backpacks

- **Custom Mobs:** Add your own mobs with simple goal-based AI - supports custom models too! Create:
  - Animals
  - Hostile mobs
  - Supports custom attributes
  - Control spawn chances and biomes to spawn in

## Installation
Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer).  
Download filament and drop the `example_datapack` into the `datapacks` folder of your server world. filament uses Polymer's resource pack generation and hosting features.

## Usage
An example datapack is available in the GitHub repo. Just drop it into your world's datapacks folder.
